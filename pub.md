Eurosceptics In The Pub
=======================

Who: moderate Eurosceptics, who want to leave or strongly reform the EU

Where: Rose and Crown pub of Colombo St Southwark in London, upstairs

Next meeting: Wednesday 10 December 2014, 7pm

Meetup page: [Link - please use this to tell us you're coming and get told about each month's meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Eurosceptics-In-The-Pub)

Why:

* In the next few years, Britain will decide whether its future is to 
  remain in the European Union, probably by a referendum. 
* Today, there are basically no strong, independent, grassroots, cross-party 
  [Eurosceptic organisations](organisations.html) or movements. 
* The majority of the British public is Eurosceptic, but to varying degrees. 
  Some favour reform, whilst others favour outright withdrawal from all or 
  part of the EU. 
* Come a referendum, the British public needs to be armed with the best 
  arguments the Eurosceptic side has to offer, and these are not yet being 
  developed effectively
* The political class benefits too much from Europe to deliver a Eurosceptic
   victory, so concerned citizens need to band together to fight for one.

If you share these concerns, please come along.
