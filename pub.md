title: Eurosceptics In The Pub

Invitation
==========

Who: moderate Eurosceptics

Where: Rose and Crown pub of Colombo St Southwark in London, upstairs

When: 7pm, 10 July 2014

Why:

* In the next few years, Britain will decide whether its future is to remain in the European Union, probably by a referendum. 
* Today, there are basically no strong, independent, grassroots, cross-party Eurosceptic organisations or movements. 
* The majority of the British public is Eurosceptic, but to varying degrees. Some favour reform, whilst others favour outright withdrawal from all or part of the EU. 
* Come a referendum, the British public needs to be armed with the best arguments the Eurosceptic side has to offer, and these are not yet being developed effectively
* The political class benefits too much from Europe to deliver a Eurosceptic victory, so concerned citizens need to band together to fight for one.
