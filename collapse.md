title: Will the EU collapse?
---

Basically no-one actually thinks the EU, as currently constituted, is
in any way a good idea. Whether one says this publicly is a matter of
how one wishes to be perceived. In the UK, support for the EU is
basically a way of signalling that one is against nationalism, facism,
racism, traditionalism, various forms of conservatism, etc. Opposition
to the EU has often been *perceived to have been* dominated by
undesirable, politically-incorrect types. This common
perception of Euroscepticism is wrong, like so many common
perceptions.

The most committed Europhiles basically privately admit the entire
thing is a catastrophe and work diligently for its reform. No intelligent
person with self-respect defends the status quo.

My 11 points on the front page of this website fall into three categories: the absence
of most features of Europe-level democracy, the misdesign and
misbehaviour of actors (legislators, officials, judges) in the
European lawmaking processes, and the undesirable effects this all has
on policy outcomes.

So as Abraham Lincoln didn't ask, can a government neither of the
people, nor by the people, nor for the people, long endure?

I see no reason to believe that it could. Either democracy will come
to the EU, and so radically transform it as it no longer retain any
meaningful identity with the constitutional structures we see today,
or countries will vote to withdraw.

The effect of the undemocratic operation of the EU is to transfer
resources and power to people who would not otherwise receive them. It
is irrational for any group of people to tolerate this
indefinitely. Ireland didn't tolerate being governed from London in
1920, and I suppose the current rule from further east will be equally
unwelcome. Most countries formerly controlled by the UK obtained their
independence peacefully, and if independence is good enough for
Canada, for Nigeria, for India and the rest, why is independence not
good enough for the UK?
