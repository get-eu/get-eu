Meeting: Eurosceptics in the Pub
Venue: Rose and Crown pub, Southwark, London
Time: 7pm
Note-taker: Martin Keegan


There was about half an hour of talking in small groups, then Martin Keegan
and Stuart Coster spoke for about ten minutes each, followed by a group
discussion.

The main conclusions of the discussion were that recruitment was a
priority, and that there should be monthly meetings in London on a
regular schedule, namely second Thursday of the month at the current venue.
We have re-booked the venue for 14 August at 7pm; we don't pay for the
room directly and informally need to keep it worthwhile for the landlord
by buying enough drinks.

Many attendees were interested in research and in what can be done
digitally.  There was a bit of discussion about how to stay in touch
online, with a rough consensus for Meetup.com for the time
being. There was a generally agreed upon sentiment that we need an
online platform to discuss and arrange meetings.

There was a general feeling that there weren't enough left wingers present
and that we should just invite someone from the Greens to address the 
next meeting.


David Warwicker commended the book "Revolt On The Right" by Goodwin and Ford.
Someone also seems to have brought Larry Siedentop's book "Democracy in
Europe" to the venue. Stuart Coster commended "How to Win Campaigns" by
Chris Rose (at least in part).

There was a considerable effort expended per attendee by the organisers;
please try to persuade / bring a friend for the next meeting.

Again, thanks to everyone for coming (particularly Tom who came from
Birmingham!) and contributing.
