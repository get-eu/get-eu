* stability and growth pact insufficient
* separation of fiscal and monetary policy
* fixed exchange rates force internal devaluation
* French and Germans don't really agree about democratic control of
  monetary policy
* German interest rates don't suit mortgage states (Spain, Ireland)
* exchange rate won't fit all
* Giovannini criteria not actually fixed
* forgot about bank supervision / resolution / regional bank idiocy
