What does leaving the EU mean?
==============================

There are several overlapping trans-European agreements that European
countries can participate in: the EU, the EEA, the Customs Union, the
Single Market, the Euro, Schengen, NATO, and so on. It is
theoretically possible to be a member of almost combination of them
(see image at bottom of page).

The situation is sufficiently complex, and the UK so large, that any change
would take a long time and disrupt existing arrangements, like a heavy
passenger jumping between two small moving boats. Realistically, UK withdrawal
would be a multi-stage process that changes the set of feasible options
for European co-operation. 

Models
------

* Leave the political union, stay in EEA/Single Market: "Norway option" / "government by fax"
* Leave the bureaucracy union, rejoin EFTA: "Switzerland option" / "government by guillotine"
* Leave political union and Single Market, stay in customs union: "Turkey model"
* Leave EU, EEA and Customs Union: the "Japan model"
