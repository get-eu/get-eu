How do you square support for democracy with this “anti-nationalism”?
Do you know how that makes you sound to a lot of Irish people? What
position can someone with such views take on the claims of other
conquered / colonised people who wish to run their own affairs? Is it
really democratic to say “you bunch of people who want to run your own
country are just not going to be allowed to; you’re going to have to
be bound, for no justifiable reason, by the decision of others”.

@Richard Laming: you’re conflating ex post review of legislation with
review of executive action.

I should have been clearer: the ECJ has almost never (only once?) said
that a piece of legislation has been ultra vires the powers of the EU
vs the member states. It has indeed, as you say, said that individual
bodies such as the Commission have acted ultra vires, but that is not
the same thing (the position of the UK courts is analogous: what’s
being overturned is executive action, not legislation).

Citizens do sometimes have standing to challenge things before the
ECJ; again, I believe this a dead letter in practice.

I don’t agree that MS governments are always incentivised to stand up
for MS legislative competence as against the EU. The Council
horse-trading process allows them to sidestep legislative and other
political opposition domestically.
