Federalism and Contract

A federal polity enjoys an inherently limited government

* inasmuch as the different levels of government must forfend to infringe on each other's spheres of competence
* in some respects therefore it is like dealing with a foreign power
    - no conrol legally recognised
    - would required non-consensually imposed political change to make law effective across both national borders or the fed/state division

(C) a functioning federal polity is only stable where mainstream political opinion remains committed to it
* same can be said of any constitutional setup

effectively, a political society committed to the inherently limited form og governanment constituted by federalism

this sentiment is what makes the agreement not to shift the federal/state boundary stick - ex hypothesia there's no government to make it stick

allocation of borders between interests WITHOUT law

(B) competences may be regarded as sitting in a relation to a federal/state boundary, such that any given competence is either
* exclusive state competence
* exclusive or preemptive federal competence
* a shared competence

(B') soft / hard federalism: soft federalism permits competences to be transferred unilaterally (e.g., India, EU)
(or is it that competences do not stably stay on their side of the line? )
* we are excluding cases like the UK where one body can alter the powers of another unilaterally

All observed federal states are defined territorially such that the generality of territory within the Federation also comprises territory of exactly one State (population significance of territory)
* this may be a negative international constraint

The federal/state boundary will come under pressure, as a constraint on political / legistlative activity at either governmental level, therefore need impartial or at least bipartisanly-trustwed courts / resolution procedures

Reformulation:

multiple sites of government

* (0) some acts only valid if done by a particular site of government
* (A) is the structure relating the sites
    - territorial in all known examples
* (B) is a reformulation of (0)
    - (B') is a modification to cover borderline cases
* (C) is (B) restated in realist political / social terms; its the social glue that makes (B) work stably

The characteristics of the settlement in (B) are crucial for politics and efficiency and justice

* one could settle (B) on utilitarian grounds - those things best ordered federally shall be so ordered, and accordingly for the states; anything crossing state boundaries (some sort of externality) should be federal (begs and international question)
* or one could claim that there are some things best ordered at the level of most effective democratic scrutiny (whether this is S or F or irrelevant depends upon the individual polities concerned)
    - this can be restated in terms of the preceding paragraph by modifying the utility function assumed. however this may render that function higly relative to the conditions in question, particularly the governance of the states

in the EU the scheme is to make the federal/state boundary very permeable, and apply the so-called pricnple of subsidiarity for reviewing the propriety of individual measures

subsidiarity actually favours S's over the F

the way it operates is AFTER competences have been allocated their place in relation to the f/s divide. it is not employed in determining the initial al
