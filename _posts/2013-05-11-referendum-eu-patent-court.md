title: A referendum .. on the EU's Patent Court?
---


The Danish and Irish governments have [announced](http://www.jonworth.eu/denmarks-possible-eu-patent-court-referendum-an-opportunity/)
that they expect to hold refendums on their countries'
participation in the new European Unified Patent Court. Why
hasn't the United Kingdom done likewise?


Denmark and the Republic of Ireland are burdened by written
statutory constitutions, and these documents happen to require special
permission before their parliaments can validly hand over power to a
foreign body. In the Danish case, this is because the constitution
says that outright, whereas Ireland has an American-style ban on
delegating legislative or judicial authority, and since the [Crotty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotty_v._An_Taoiseach)
judgment in the 1980s this has been recognised as requiring that the
constitution be amended to achieve any delegations of power.


The Danish system requires a parliamentary supermajority of 5/6ths
*or* a referendum. Amending the Irish consitution requires a
referendum. So both countries are having one.


The UK, on the other hand, has a written, non-statutory
constitution (it's spread across hundreds of documents). The
UK's law, under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/12/contents">European
Union Act 2011</a>, requires a referendum when powers are transferred
to the European Union, in various senses of
&#8220;transferred&#8221;. Effectively, this is when the EU Treaties
are formally amended conferring new powers on the EU. There are lots
of tricky ways of doing this, and ways of the achieving the same
result, particularly by removing vetoes or changing voting
requirements, and the 2011 Act goes to absurd lengths trying to
categorise all of these. The Act is basically a [list](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/12/schedule/1)
of all the ways the EU's treaties can be amended by the back
door. Well, almost all.


Unfortunately, the EU's own constitution (its treaties)
combines the worst features of French and British constitutional
practice: the countries share a tradition of not really allowing the
courts to &#8220;strike down&#8221; legislation, and Britain has a
constitution which overtly is not contained in a single document (most
countries' constitutions are not *really* contained in a
single document. The UK has never adopted this pretence), and can
evolve as a result of covert political activism by politicians, civil
servants and the courts. A lot of the powers enjoyed by the EU have
really been arrogated to it by European court in Luxembourg. A bunch
of lobbyists decide to get a directive passed which slightly oversteps
the limits of the EU's powers; so long as it has been passed by
the correct legislative procedures (and the Luxembourg court is very
fair on this), <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/03/08/ecj-rubber-stamp-replacement/">the
Court will allow it to stand</a>, just as the British courts let an
act of Parliament stand, even if it breaches human rights.


People *think* the EU has an American style supreme court
which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison">strikes down
legislation</a>, but this is nonsense.


Accordingly, powers can be acquired by the EU other than by treaty
amendment. The 2011 Act does not protect against this with a
referendum lock. In the case of the common European patent system, the
measures are being adopted slightly outside the EU's machinery
anyway, and the 2011 Act only really covers formal EU matters arising
from particular Treaty articles.


The Irish and Danish rules are defined in terms of who is losing
power, not *how* it is being lost, and so cannot be
circumvented by the courts or enhanced co-operation.


This is not to say that there *shouldn't* be a
referendum in the UK about this, just that the legal argument that
there *has* to be is by no means an open-and-shut case, and
given that even discussing it involves discussing the fact that the
2011 Act is a sham means it's not likely to get discussed
much.


Substantively, the patent policy is a bad one. Patents do not and
should not have their own court system. The experience of the United
States has been that the creation of a parellel court system for
patent cases has [unbalanced](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/why-there-are-too-many-patents-in-america/259725/)
the patent system in favour of particular economic interest
groups. Removing patent litigation from the general business of the
Luxembourg court (however dishonestly that court might be interpreting
the treaties) is the policy of rent-seekers.
