title: Legitimacy
---

For people to
talk about achieving, say, a "social Europe" or a "free-market Europe" 
is for them to talk about
*illegitimately* achieving their objectives.

This is basic democratic / constitutionalist potty training. Movements
should *not* go about asking "hmm, how can we get what we want without
doing it democratically?"

*Any* discussion of what the EU should do is a discussion of how to
 avoid proper democratic scrutiny of a policy, and so there should be
 no such discussion until the legitimacy issues are resolved.


Which demos?
------------

The GLA example is a good one: what is necessary for the GLA / Mayor
to be legitimate is not that the electorate feel that they’re
Londoners (I don’t – I’ve only lived here five years), but that the
generality of them are happy to abide by decisions of a London-wide
majority. This is testable by opinion polling.

If a polity lacks legitimacy in this sense, then people will start
opposing its constitutional setup as such, as well as decisions taken
under it. And they’d be right: there’s less of a moral reason to obey
the law (particularly a bad law) if it’s not democratically
legitimate.

There are lots of mechanisms for dealing with trans-border issues
affecting multiple polities: Benvenisti’s book “Sharing Transboundary
Resources” is excellent on the effects of institutional setups on
common resources such as lakes. The EU is only one set of such
mechanisms, and a bad and unjustifiable one at that.

It is not the case that the generality of people, in any EU country,
are happy to be bound by an EU-wide majority on almost any subject
(except possibly the Eurovision Song Contest, which would be much
better conducted by Europe-wide voting). It follows that much of what
the EU does is rightly going to be regarded as illegitimate. Changing
the institutions won’t change people’s opinions quickly or greatly.

---------------

Changing the powers of the elected institutions in the EU is not going
to confer democratic legitimacy.

What is needed is for there to be a rough consensus amongst the
generality of the population in each Member State, that they are
prepared to be bound by the decisions of an EU-wide majority in the
areas with which the EU concerns itself. The EU is hopelessly short of
this sort of legitimacy.

To argue that this *isn’t* necessary puts one on the opposite side
from Home Rule in 1918, and on the Tory side in the American
Revolution.


Competence usurpation
---------------------

Most EU competences
are acquired not by treaty change but by treaty violation ratified by
the Luxembourg Court, which has fewer than ten times (maybe fewer than
three) in fifty years decided that a particular matter was outside the
EU’s competence. Not only do the Irish have to worry about competence
creep and a partisan judiciary, but horse-trading. It’s no good for
tax harmonisation to require unanimity if the Irish Government can
make a deal in COREPER trading off Ireland’s veto for something else.

What competences?
-----------------

There’s no prospect of adequate democracy at EU level.

There’s a logically prior question about *what* ought to be decidable
democratically at EU level.

Is there much evidence that citizens want to be bound by EU-wide
majorities on particular policy issues, e.g., quantitative studies,
broken down by policy area or country?

If there’s no demand for trans-EU majoritarianism, increasing the
powers of political institutions which can impose trans-EU policies is
only going to decrease the extent to which government is by consent,
and government without consent is unsustainable. Indeed, Europe’s main
supranational state, the United Kingdom, fell apart in the 1920s as
most of Ireland did not consent to being governed from London. Never
let it be said that supranationalism prevents war ;)


Direct election of executive
----------------------------

Some say a legitimate EU democracy requires a directly-elected
executive. That’s setting the bar pretty high, as most Member States
have indirectly elected executives – all the constitutional monarchies
have to, and there are great parliamentary republics such as Germany
and Italy. There’s more than one legitimate structural model. We do
not, *always*, have to copy the French and the Americans.

Subsidiarity
------------

Subsidiarity is, in practice, non-existent. To have actually
existing subsidiarity, you need an enforcement mechanism. I think the
enforcement mechanism needs to be judicial. (The ability of Member
State legislatures to be able to block Directives on subsidiarity
grounds is really a mechanism for preventing those legislatures from
blocking Directives on non-subsidiarity grounds such as legality). The
ECJ in Luxembourg has proven, beyond any doubt whatsoever, that it
cannot be trusted to enforce subsidiarity. I think it’s a waste of
time; subsidiarity was basically just borrowed out of Catholic Social
Teaching to help get Maastricht past the nay-sayers, and has never
been taken seriously by the authorities.

-------
The EU *does* suffer from problems
analogous to those the UK faced in the 1910s: the majority of the
population of the UK no longer accepts the constitutional position of
the terms of the UK’s membership of the EU.

As to national parliaments and subsidiarity, it’s a moot point given
that there’s no effective mechanism for rejecting EU legislation which
is ultra vires the Treaties, let alone EU legislation in areas of
legally legitimate EU competence which happen to violate subsidiarity.



------------

The majority of British people want less decision-making to be done at
EU level. If these opinions do not change, would it be democratic to
keep Britain in the EU, under the current or similar terms? Is it
democratic to keep preventing them from having a say on any
constitutional developments since Thatcher’s Single European Act?

It seems to me to be a contradiction in terms to want affairs within
the EU be conducted more in accordance with the wishes of citizens,
when the citizens don’t want affairs to be conducted within the EU in
the first place.

Is it logically consistent to say that it’s Ok for the USA, Ireland,
Scotland, Kenya, South Africa, Cyprus, Israel, Southern Rhodesia, etc
to become independent of the UK, but that it is not Ok for the UK to
be independent of the EU?
