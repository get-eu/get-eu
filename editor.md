title: The Editor

The editor of this site is [Martin Keegan](http://mk.ucant.org). I am not
an academic, lawyer or politician, just a concerned citizen who happens to be
well informed about the European Union, constitutional law, history
and economics.

I became interested in the EU when studying law at Cambridge University.
Around 2002 I formed a highly negative view of the European Union when
I tried to oppose a piece of European legislation (the Copyright Directive);
it was seeing the European legislative process at close quarters
which convinced me that the European Union was, on balance, very bad
for democracy, freedom, prosperity, equality and efficiency.

My day job is solving business problems that involve computers. I maintain
this site as a hobby.
