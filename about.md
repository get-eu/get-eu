Taking

This website is political propaganda. I am *not* trying to make money
out of it. Accordingly, the text of the site is subject to copyright,
and it is licensed under the fairly liberal terms of the [Creative

licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). What that
means is that you can

* make your own copy of all or part of the site, free of charge
* sell a printed version of some or all of the text
* set up a competing version, or slightly different version, on your
  webspace

The conditions which apply concern giving credit to the contributors,
and allowing others to use any version you make, under the same terms.

I expect that one day I shall lose interest in this project or run out
of time for it, and that others might want to carry it on. Don't waste
anyone's time asking for permission, you already have it.
