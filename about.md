You can contribute to this website; you don't need to know much about
web development to do so.



Giving
------

The text of this site is managed via [Github](http://github.com), at
[this location](https://github.com/mk270/get-eu). You can use a range
of tools to contribute new articles, fix typos, remove out of date
content and so on.

For example, here is the [the source text for this page](https://raw.github.com/mk270/get-eu/gh-pages/about.md).

Explaining how to do all this is slightly beyond the scope of this page,
but get in touch if you need some help.

You can also help by sending me

* news articles
* websites
* academic papers

containing pro-EU arguments that still need to be rebutted

Taking
------

This website is political propaganda. I am *not* trying to make money
out of it. Accordingly, the text of the site is subject to copyright,
and it is licensed under the fairly liberal terms of the [Creative
Commons 3.0 Attribution Share-Alike
licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). What that
means is that you can

* make your own copy of all or part of the site, free of charge
* sell a printed version of some or all of the text
* set up a competing version, or slightly different version, on your
  webspace

The conditions which apply concern giving credit to the contributors,
and allowing others to use any version you make, under the same terms.

I expect that one day I shall lose interest in this project or run out
of time for it, and that others might want to carry it on. Don't waste
anyone's time asking for permission, you already have it.
