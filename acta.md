ACTA is an agreement between national governments. It obligates them
to legislate in a particular fashion. It can’t be amended by their
legislatures, only accepted or rejected. It will be very expensive to
amend the agreement itself, as this would basically require unanimity
between the signatory states. ACTA never appeared on any election
manifesto, and has been driven by lobbyists working for concentrated
producer interests, using civil servants, and the executive branch of
governments to negotiate the details of future legislation behind the
backs of parliaments.

For me, this makes ACTA bad, even without considering its content or
effects.

It’s also a description true of … every European directive. The EU is
basically one generalised policy laundering machine.
