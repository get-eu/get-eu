Supranationalism
================

Supranationalism is a form of international government or lawmaking in
which multiple nations are bound together by institutions over which
they do not have control. Some aspects of the EU are supranational,
such as the EU's Court of Justice, and areas of decision-making in
which there are no national vetoes. Supranationalism contrasts with
intergovernmentalism, a mode of international governance in which
collective actions must be agreed to by participating nations.
