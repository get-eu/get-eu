Microeconomic reform
====================

* standardised regulation is not necessary for free trade
* regulation affects legal relations between individuals
* regulation is always an opportunity for rent seeking; more democracy means less rent
* too much regulation can make for a socially harmonious economy that [stagnates](micro-stagnation.html) because no-one has an incentive to innovate as much as foreigners 
* differential law-abidingness has been weaponised
* technocracy has failed on its own terms: the regulations are less efficient than those of a democracy
* undemocratic regulation increases economic inequality along the lines of political connectedness (in fact the *exact* opposite of what supposed free trade / lack of state aid was supposed to achieve)
* eu law is used to harm competing businesses - the net effect is greater than the benefits
* diffuse costs, concentrated benefits
* used as a weapon against particular countries
