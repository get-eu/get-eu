Democracy
=========

* [Supranational democracy cannot exist](suprademocracy.html)
* [Consent and legitimacy](consent-and-legitimacy.html)
* [Electoral systems](ep-electoral-system.html)


Rebutting Europhile arguments
=============================

Almost all Europhile arguments about the "democratic deficit" boil down to
one of the following:

* democracy is a bad thing anyway
* the UK, or some other member state, is undemocratic, 
  therefore the EU's lack of democracy is irelevant
* the parts of the EU which are undemocratic ought to be undemocratic (e.g.,
  monetary policy); or, more sympathetically, there exist matters which ought
  not to be decided democratically, and these are the sorts of things the EU
  tends to do
* there is a "real" definition of democracy, different from the normal use
  of the word, which coincidentally happens to mean the EU is democratic

More intellectually honest Europhiles will tend to acknowledge that the EU's
democratic record is atrocious, but they will often propose remedies which
will either not improve the situation, or make it worse.


Other (unedited notes)
======================

europhiles claim that the problem with democarcy in the Eu would be
fixed if the eu institutions were democratic. this just isn't true.

the fundamental point is that people do not consent to being governed by
an EU wide majority on anything.

consider the strcutre of eu governance:

  there are potential subjects of government action: health, criminal
  justice, economic regulation, trade, tax, redisttribution, welfare,
  etc, etc; these are hopefully termed "competences" in eu jargon
  
  a legal system identifies which level of government has the final
  say over a competence: e.g., health at national "member state"
  level, and trade at eu "federal" level

  this decision basically needs to be done by a court, interpreting a
  constitution

  in the EU, the court which does this is basically a sham, and has
  only sided against federal competence once in sixty years

  it is therefore possible to talk about the optimal allocation of
  competences, the de jure competences according to treaty, the de
  facto allocation of competences according to the
  [ECJ](glossary.html), and the allocation of competences according to
  democratic consent

  it will be observed that de facto competences are allocated by the
  ECJ in violation of the treaties; it is thus possible that if the
  treaties do not reflect people's preferences, the court might be
  correcting this. readers familiar with these matters may have
  concluded i put this in as a little joke. the court doesn't give a
  f*** about how people want competences allocated.


if a competence is held at federal level, then a particular state can
be outvoted by a federation-wide majority. if people in a state will
be consistently outvoted on some policy, they'll favour the relevant
competence being held at state level. on other matters they can horse
trade, but this concentrates power in the state-elvel political
elite. if there's nothing they can horsetrade about, then they should
leave the federation (e.g., ireland from uk)

(you can't easily horsetrade or advocate across linguistic boundaries)

so, the hard version:

  if the federation and the state are equally democratic, in the sense of
  equally responsive to citizens (not in the sense of being consented to),
  but one state's people don't want to be a part of the federation because
  the're consistently outvoted or for any other reason, is any harm done?

  it reduces to a simple cost benefit analysis: are the preferences of
  citizens of the state better satisfied by any allocation of competences
  to the federation; if not, then the state should leave ;  this goes
  even if there cn be horsetrading

  absence of consent for a competence to be exercised at a federal level
  means there are no horsetrades you'd willingly do

  does this necessarily lead to greater rent-seeking? probably - you can't
  get democratic opposition to a rent-seeking proposal at federal level
  without conceding federal competence

  there's less likely to be political engagement with an illegitimate
  government


two diversions:

  legislatures dont make maximal use of their control over the executive's
  role in the council of ministers

  it is possible to identify some undemocratic feature of an eu member
  state, however much it may exceed the eu in democracy, e.g., the UK's
  house of lords, but this hardly applies to germany or ireland

other nonsense:

  democracy a bad thing

  redefine democracy (no true democracy if it lacks the feature which lets
  me win the argument)

the civil service is politically partisan
