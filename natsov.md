The progressive case against international treaties
===================================================


Introduction
------------

Too many of the laws that affect us day-to-day have their origins in
secret treaty negotiations, rather than election manifestos and
speeches in parliaments and public forums by actual politicians that
people can actually vote for. International treaties acquired a good
reputation after the First World War, as mechanisms which banned
and limited outrageous acts of warfare and guaranteed safe havens for
refugees, but like so much else, treaty-making has now been captured by
narrow well-organised interest groups and devolved into just one more
system of exploitation.




Mechanism
---------

When a particular interest group has a policy it wants governments to adopt,
there are three main ways of getting it adopted and protecting it from
amendment and repeal:

* enacting the policy as a law
* getting the policy entrenched in the national constitution
* getting the policy adopted as a treaty

It turns out that while the first and second of these are more likely to
get the policy enforced, the third is more likely to protect it from
repeal in the long-term, once the downsides of the policy have been felt
by the public.

For the last forty years, the treaty-making powers of states have been
a significant enabler of "rent-seeking" and "crony capitalism".

If the first "advantage" of treaties is that they are hard to repeal or
amend once enacted (normally involving consensus among the countries
that signed), the other great benefit is that they are less democratic:
publicity and parliamentary scrutiny are extremely low for treaties: 

* the text is negotiated in secret by bureaucrats, lobbyists and the occasional elected minister
* there may be no parliamentary involvement at all in ratification
* parliamentary involvement may be limited to approval, without the ability to amend or horse-trade
* there is very little publicity, and everything can be kept hush-hush on grounds of compromising the country's negotiating position
* there is almost always a significant benefit to a country in signing a treaty: this is used as a blunt club to get the public to pay the huge costs

Mechanical arguments

race to bottom

the left doesn't bother with race-to-bottom arguments outside the EU; it
sticks to actually winning elections


undemocratically increasing protection why not decreasing instead?


if it could be achieved democratically, it would be

not on manifesto ; if not for the ppl then for whom?

Social justice
--------------

treaty regimes are protectionist / economic racism

redistributive: dispersed costs, concentrated benefits

imperalism
