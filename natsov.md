The progressive case against international treaties
===================================================


Introduction
------------

The problem
-----------

Mechanism
---------


treaties: parliaments and presidents

game theory of concessions
prisoners dilemma

lock in law LT constitution LT treaty

expanding circles of western countries

Mechanical arguments
--------------------

race to bottom

the left doesn't bother with race-to-bottom arguments outside the EU; it
sticks to actually winning elections


undemocratically increasing protection why not decreasing instead?


if it could be achieved democratically, it would be

not on manifesto ; if not for the ppl then for whom?

Social justice
--------------

treaty regimes are protectionist / economic racism

redistributive: dispersed costs, concentrated benefits

WITBD
-----

moratorium

Conclusion
----------

imperalism



Notes
-----

labouring under an ignorance of foreigners indistinguishable from xenophobia


what is the limit? "what is not true now is not going to become both true and immutable in the future"


regulatory aristocracy
