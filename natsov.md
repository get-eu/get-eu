The progressive case against international treaties
===================================================


Introduction
------------

Too many of the laws that affect us day-to-day have their origins in
secret treaty negotiations, rather than election manifestos and
speeches in parliaments and public forums by actual politicians that
people can actually vote for. International treaties acquired a good
reputation after the First World War, as mechanisms which banned
and limited outrageous acts of warfare and guaranteed safe havens for
refugees, but like so much else, treaty-making has now been captured by
narrow well-organised interest groups and devolved into just one more
system of exploitation.




Mechanism
---------


treaties: parliaments and presidents

game theory of concessions
prisoners dilemma

lock in law LT constitution LT treaty

expanding circles of western countries

Mechanical arguments
--------------------

race to bottom

the left doesn't bother with race-to-bottom arguments outside the EU; it
sticks to actually winning elections


undemocratically increasing protection why not decreasing instead?


if it could be achieved democratically, it would be

not on manifesto ; if not for the ppl then for whom?

Social justice
--------------

treaty regimes are protectionist / economic racism

redistributive: dispersed costs, concentrated benefits

WITBD
-----

moratorium

Conclusion
----------

imperalism



Notes
-----

labouring under an ignorance of foreigners indistinguishable from xenophobia


what is the limit? "what is not true now is not going to become both true and immutable in the future"


regulatory aristocracy
