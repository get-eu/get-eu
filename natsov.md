The progressive case against international treaties
===================================================


Introduction
------------

Too many of the laws that affect us day-to-day have their origins in
secret treaty negotiations, rather than election manifestos and
speeches in parliaments and public forums by actual politicians that
people can actually vote for. International treaties acquired a good
reputation after the First World War, as mechanisms which banned
and limited outrageous acts of warfare and guaranteed safe havens for
refugees, but like so much else, treaty-making has now been captured by
narrow well-organised interest groups and devolved into just one more
system of exploitation.




Mechanism
---------

When a particular interest group has a policy it wants governments to adopt,
there are three main ways of getting it adopted and protecting it from
amendment and repeal:

* enacting the policy as a law
* getting the policy entrenched in the national constitution
* getting the policy adopted as a treaty

It turns out that while the first and second of these are more likely to
get the policy enforced, the third is more likely to protect it from
repeal in the long-term, once the downsides of the policy have been felt
by the public.

For the last forty years, the treaty-making powers of states have been
a significant enabler of "rent-seeking" and "crony capitalism".

Mechanical arguments
--------------------

race to bottom

the left doesn't bother with race-to-bottom arguments outside the EU; it
sticks to actually winning elections


undemocratically increasing protection why not decreasing instead?


if it could be achieved democratically, it would be

not on manifesto ; if not for the ppl then for whom?

Social justice
--------------

treaty regimes are protectionist / economic racism

redistributive: dispersed costs, concentrated benefits

moratorium

Conclusion
----------

imperalism



Notes
-----

labouring under an ignorance of foreigners indistinguishable from xenophobia


what is the limit? "what is not true now is not going to become both true and immutable in the future"
