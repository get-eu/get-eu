title: Why this site?
---

This site, get-eu.org, exists to provide independent, high-quality
criticism of the European Union.


Independent
-----------

The site is not financially backed by any organisation. It's therefore not
beholden to any particular ideology or party line, e.g., to renegotiate
the EU's structure radically then stay in.

The editor is [Martin Keegan](http://mk.ucant.org), who believes that the
UK, and pretty much everyone else, should leave the EU.

High Quality
------------

Attention is finite. We're only awake so many hours a day. Bad eurosceptic
arguments are *actively counterproductive*, as they divert attention
from good eurosceptic arguments. Vichy Euroscepticism just helps the other
side.

On get-eu.org, you won't find anyone advancing these sorts of arguments,
about "superstates", "sovereignty" or the symbolism of the EU. These are
a waste of precious time, and in any case, the EU has a very nice flag.
It just shouldn't be allowed to be flown from public buildings in the UK.
