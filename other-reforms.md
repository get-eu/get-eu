What reforms could be made short of leaving the EU?
===================================================

The following measures, which would make the EU more law-bound and democratic
and responsive to public opinion, could be adopted unilaterally by member
states. These things could be done as well as, or instead of, leaving the EU.

* all EU Court decisions that violate the treaties to be declarable as 
  invalid by national courts, analogous to the UK courts' ability to make a 
  "declaration of incompatibility" between national statutes and the ECHR
* any new powers arrogated to the EU by the EU Court to be subject to 
  national referendums
* a new criminal offence committed when any national minister overrides 
  his/her parliament's scrutiny reserve in the Council of Ministers
* an EU-wide ban on compulsory identity cards and other state surveillance 
  measures incompatible with democracy
* mandatory referendum on new member states
* national parliament vetos on all directives
* EU membership to be subject to referendum every 10 years
* parliamentarians could pledge to obstruct the implementation of EU directives
  which had been opposed by a sufficiently large petition by voters
