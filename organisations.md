In the UK, there are many Eurosceptic organisations; unfortunately,
there are very few independent grassroots ones that are still going
strong; Euroscepticism tends to be represented by organisations with
broader agendas, such as political parties and campaign groups.

For example, NO2EU and Better Off Out are sincere Eurosceptic
organisations, but they make it quite clear that they are also
campaigns linked to other groups: NO2EU is a robustly left-wing
electoral alliance supported by trades unions and the Communist Party
of Britain; Better Off Out is run by the robustly right-wing Freedom
Association. If you are a centrist Eurosceptic swing voter, it would
be difficult to join one of these groups as you would probably
disagree with them about everything *except* Europe.
